# Final Project - Introduction to Machine Learning
## Introduction
This Jupiter Notebook will be creating a machine learning model and will use the \"Cheese\" Dataset. This dataset is can originally be found on the Government of Canada's Open Government Portal, but has been modified by the course instructors for use in this project.
### Question of Interest
I will use this data set to create a predictive model that will predict the Manufacturing type of our cheese. The positive label in this data is artisan. I would like to ask this question because I am interested to see if a specific type of milk is more commonly used in artisan cheeses. This is a classfication problem and I will use a Support Vector Metric classifier to create my model.
### Dataset Description"

    - CheeseId
    - ManufacturerProvCode
    - ManufacturingTypeEn
